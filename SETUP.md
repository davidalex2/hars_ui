# HARS UI Setup Guide

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd hars_ui
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure API Endpoint**
   
   Edit `src/services/api.ts` and ensure the API_BASE_URL matches your backend:
   ```typescript
   const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:9090';
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`

## Development

The UI uses:

All API calls are handled through service files in `src/services/`.
